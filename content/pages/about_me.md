The website will serve as a place to record all my experiments around Python, learnings about cloud technologies and musings on technology as well as Enterprise Architecture. The urge to write is constant and real. 

This website is an experiment in leveraging free hosting and some excellent open source tools to host and run my own blog. I have created this blog using Pelican to generate static files and the blog in Python , Bootstrap for the theme, Github for the hosting and publishing.

I have followed the steps indicated here on the [blog by Matthew Devaney](https://matthewdevaney.com/posts/2019/03/04/build-a-blog-with-pelican-and-python-pt-1-installation-theme/ "blog by Matthew Devaney")  to create this website. The only difference being that I have set up my local blog on my machine in the Python virtual environment to ensure I don't impact the other Python projects on my machine.
