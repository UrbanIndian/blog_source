Every Cloud implementation team or CoE team in an organization adopts a journey of moving from cloud strategy to implementation. Underpinning this journey is usually a bunch of artifacts - all of which help provide direction and support to the Cloud CoE teams.

As shown in the diagram above, the strategy and architecture team usually helps create artifacts such as strategy documents, Cloud Enterprise Architecture patterns, Tooling Patterns and Solution Patterns. 

Solution patterns are usually based on inputs from the strategy documentation, EA patterns and project specific design pattern requirements. Solution patterns inform and help define project specific solution design documentation. Project specific solution design is usually created by cloud implementation project teams or Cloud CoE team. 

Project specific build and configuration related documentation will also be required for each implementation. This would also be a Cloud CoE/cloud implementation team responsibility.
